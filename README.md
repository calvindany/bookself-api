# bookself-api

This is project to fulfill my final assignment in Dicoding "Learn to Build Back-End Applications for Beginners with Google Cloud" course. The app will provide an API that can perform CRUD on data stores. 

> This project storange for the data stores only valid in memory. So, if the server is restarted, the data that has been entered will be lost and will be required to re-enter the data.

## Instalation
Before run the application, use ``` npm install ``` command on git bash or command prompt to install the package that needed in this project base on ```package.json```. After using the command, ```node_modules``` directory will be created automatically.
